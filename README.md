# Facile

JÃ©rÃ©my `Fa`'s `C`urated `I`nventory of `L`ibrary `E`ssentials for [Haxe](https://haxe.org).

**Facile** is a set of general purpose utilities that I use to _facilitate_ programming on my projects. It also means **easy** in French ðŸ¥–âœ¨

Maybe they can be useful to others?

More utils might be added over time. Any helper that is too small to fit in a separate library, but useful enough that it can be used in multiple contexts, may end up here.
