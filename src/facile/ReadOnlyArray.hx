 `ReadOnlyArray` is an abstract over an ordinary `Array` which only exposes
 APIs that don't modify the instance, hence "read-only".

 Note that this doesn't necessarily mean that the instance is *immutable*.
 Other code holding a reference to the underlying `Array` can still modify it,
 and the reference can be obtained with a `cast`.
